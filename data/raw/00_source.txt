Methodology rules:
- Always single and full (meaning without a hole) polygon.
- When data is not coming from authoritative source, taking as a reference OpenStreetMap (OSM).
- Checking with Google Maps if shown boundaries are the same. If not, hand-drawing within the boundaries from OSM mimicking Google Maps boundaries.
